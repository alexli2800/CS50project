#HUDS HUB

# Overview

HUDS HUB is a website that allows users to rate and review the lunch and dinner menus at Harvard. The menu will update itself every day and each meal will have an average rating made up of other user's ratings. Now, you can go into your dining hall knowing whether or not you will enjoy your meal!

# Installation
Clone the repository https://github.com/alexli2800/CS50project.git
Navigate to the folder by typing “cd CS50project” into your terminal
Run the project in your terminal by typing “flask run”

# Usage

For new users, you will be presented with a login page. You can register on the website by creating an account. Your password must be at least 8 characters long, have at least one digit, and, contain at least one special character (!, @, #, $, %).

When you are done logging in, you will be directed to your home page where you can navigate to the lunch and dinner menus of the day. You can also log out of your account if you wish to switch accounts. On the bottom of the screen is a button where you must load the HUDS menu data from Harvard’s Dining API. This will take around 1 minute to finish loading, so wait for the data to be inserted until it stops generating in your terminal before clicking other buttons.

When you click on the lunch or dinner menus, you will be directed to the respective menu served that day. Near the bottom of the page, you can click your desired star rating and optionally leave a review. Although a written review is optional, you must click the desired star rating to be able to submit.
